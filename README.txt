II. Core Concepts: 

    1. Introduction to Sequelize: 

        a. What is Sequelize ?
            - 3rd party package
            - It is an Object Relational Mapping library
                > This means It does all the SQL code behind the 
                scene for us and maps it with Javascript
                > So we never has to write SQL code on our own
            - Here is an example picture: 
            https://drive.google.com/file/d/11uznA6zS_L6T9BAMBVq6dTSyKJfkBW8_/view?usp=sharing

        b. What does Sequelize do ? 
            - Model, Instances, Queries, Associations
            - See demonstration image: 
            https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AWcbPDUxF4Q5JpBJ5NWAqUfa7WfSDgQr/view?usp=sharing

    2. Association: 
        - A connection between 2 table is called an Association
        - For example: table 'products' and 'users' are connected
            by 'userId' field
        - See this image for project association map:

III. Module Notes: 

    1. Setting up: 
        - All see 2nd Commit
        Remember to install all the packages listed above

        a. Database Utility Set Up:
            - Creating Sequilize Instance
            - Creating connection pool to MySQL 
            - See ./util/database.js
            
        b. Sequelize Model Set Up: 
            - Defining Model for Data Operations
            - See ./models/product.js
        
        c. Sequilize Sync Set Up: 
            - Create Tables in Database
            - Make Tables Relations
            - See app.js

    2. Basic Operations (CRUD): 
        a. Inserting data (Record) to table: 
            - Code in 3rd Commit
            - See ./controllers/admin.js: under postAddProduct()
            to see how to add a Record

            > At this point, only http://localhost:3000/admin/add-product
            works so you can add products to the database
        
        b. Retrieving all Records: 
            - Code in 5th Commit
            - See ./controllers/shop.js: under getIndex() for '/' route
            and getProducts() for '/products' route
            - 7th Commit: 
                +, See ./controllers/admin.js: under getProducts()
                Retrieving all products for admin products 

        c. Retrieving limited Record using where and by ID: 
            - Code in 6th Commit
            - See ./controllers/shop.js: under getProduct()
                2 approach demonstrated here: 
                findByPk(): find by ID
                findAll({where})
        
        d. Updating Record: 
            - Code in 8th Commit
            - See ./controllers/admin.js: 
                +, see under getEditProduct()
                    for how to get edit product
                +, See under postEditProduct() 
                    for how to update data 
        
        e. Deleting Record: 
            - Code in 9th Commit
            - See ./controllers/admin.js. See under 
                postDeleteProduct() 
    
    3. Table Association Implementation: 
        - Code in 11st Commit
        - ./models/users.js: set up model (table) for 
        users 
        - app.js: Establising association between
            users and products table
        - Association map for this project:
